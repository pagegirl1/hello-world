# hello-world
first project on github

Hello everyone. I'm new here and just trying to get my bearings. I study physics, but I'm no rocket scientist. Just pursuing what makes me happy. My biggest dream is to travel, to see the world--not just the famous places, but the big and the small, the awesome and the ugly. Anyways, that's a little about me.
